    """Create a robotic voice effect by combining pitch shift and ring modulation.

    This operator transforms audio into a robotic/synthetic voice by:
    1. Shifting the pitch (typically upward)
    2. Applying ring modulation with a low-frequency carrier wave

    Works with raw PCM audio (standard internal format).

    Args:
        pitch: Pitch shift multiplier (default: 1.2). Values > 1.0 shift pitch up.
        carrier_freq: Ring modulator carrier frequency in Hz (default: 30.0)
                     Lower = deeper robot voice, Higher = more metallic
        carrier_waveform: Carrier waveform: "sine", "square", "saw", "triangle" (default: "square")
        ring_mix: Ring modulation wet/dry mix 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.7)

    Returns:
        An operator function that can be used with pipe()

    Examples:
        # Classic robot voice
        file_input("voice.wav").pipe(
            robotize(),
            speaker()
